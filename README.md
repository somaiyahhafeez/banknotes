# Cash Gap: more men than women on banknotes

I found [The Pudding](https://github.com/the-pudding/banknotes)'s dataset on banknotes on Data is plural and thought it would be interesting to analyze the gender distribution on banknotes.

## Project Overview

Soon I realized that the dataset only contains 38 countries so I set out to create a bigger dataset but failed and ultimately did the project using The Pudding's data. 

1. **The Pudding**: The original dataset contains information about people on banknotes from 38 countries, including their names, what their occupations were.
   
2. **Wikipedia**: In an attempt to enrich the dataset, the project included scraping information from [Wikipedia's "List of people on banknotes"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_on_banknotes) to gather additional details, such as gender and occupation. This was done by scraping the page for each person and extracting the relevant information. However, it was noted that the information may not always be up-to-date.

3. **Banknote World**: As an additional data source, [Banknote World](https://www.banknoteworld.com/banknotes/Banknotes-by-Country/) was considered, but manual data collection proved to be too time-consuming, and facial recognition challenges prevented successful scraping.

## Analysis

The data was analyzed using Python's Pandas library. It was very simple analysis of how many women and men are featured and the gender distribution per country. 
The skills that I used for this project:
- Web scraping.
- Pandas.
- Data visualization using Datawrapper.
- HTML/CSS.
